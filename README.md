### Narrative #1

```
As a user
I want to select robots, select the game mode and specify the shooting speed
So I can start the game and see the robots battle
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria)

Given the user selects robots
  And the user selects the game mode
  And the user specifies the shooting speed
 When the user taps the start button
 Then the robots start fighting  
```

### Narrative #2

```
As a user
I can not start the game when there are no robots
So the start button have to be disabled
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria)

```
Given the user selects the game mode
  And the user specifies the shooting speed
 When there are no robots
 Then the start button have to be disabled 
```

### Narrative #3

```
As a user
I can not start the game when there is no game mode
So the start button have to be disabled
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria)

```

### Story: System is ready to the battle if it receives correct list of ships from a robot

### Narrative #4

```
When the system sends battlefield size and list of possible ships to a robot
Robot have to send back ships positions
The system checks whether ships placed correctly

 When battlefield and list of possible ships are not empty
 Then robot sends back to the system non empty list of ships
```
